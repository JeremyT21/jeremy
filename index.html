            I started coding seriously in my Grade 10 year of high school.
            <br>
            I familiarized myself with coding techniques, libraries, and concepts.
            <br>
            <br>
            My abilities can be demonstrated in the projects I have on this website.
            <br>
            My projects are a mix of personal, and work done for school.

                This video game was developed by myself and two others
                <br>
                during my Grade 11 year of high school.
                <br>
                I took a lead role in designing and coding the layout
                <br>
                of HTML elements. I also was responsible for coding
                <br>
                the initial framework and progression of the video game's battle system.
                <br>
                Additionally, I created almost all the artwork assets.

                This project demonstrates my Python abilities,
                <br>
                and my familiarity with its many libraries.
                <br>
                The assignment reveals interesting trends involving
                <br>
                a person's time spent on technology and their mental health.

                This project was programmed in my second year of University
                <br>
                as part of my program for a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
