    <h2>Hiding Out</h2>

    <img src="../images/helpFour.png" class="rough">

    <p>
      This is the main screen that the player is greeted with and shown upon the introductory video concluding. The top shows a label which tells the player/user the
      location that they are in (the Hideout). There are also 4 buttons that lead the user to certain locations or open certain menus upon them being clicked.
    </p>

    <h2>Battling Enemies</h2>

    <img src="../images/helpOne.png" class="rough">

    <p>
      This is the area that the player arrives in when they have clicked the ENTER button in the Hideout. The main input keys for this section of our game are: Left Mouse Button. This section is the first part of the core of our game. In this section, you can battle enemies
      to your heart's content. There are three main buttons during any fight sequence. The RUN button, the ATTACK button and the BAG button. The function of the RUN button
      is to allow you, the user, to escape from the battle to purchase items and/or rejuvenate your health! The ATTACK button is the button that you will be using the most. This
      button allows you to directly fight the enemy that is in front of you, clear the wave that you are in and (hopefully) beat the game! Finally, the BAG button is there
      in order for you to access the potions that you purchase in the shop and view your statistics!
    </p>

    <h2>Attacking Enemies</h2>

    <img src="../images/helpFive.png" class="rough">
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="../images/helpSix.png" class="rough">

    <p>
      This is the ATTACK menu. Here, you can choose from a slightly-small list of attacks, but don't worry, the devs are adding more!
      <br>
      <br>
      Image A: Here, you can see the default attack, SUPER PUNCH, on the left-hand side of the screen. This attack deals a certain amount of damage to the enemy that you are facing.
      It's good for use in the short term, but try not to rely on it too much. In the top right, there is an EXIT button that allows the user to return to the menu in which they face the
      enemy head on.
      <br>
      <br>
      Image B: This image is very similar to Image A, however, there is a new attack that has been added due to a purchase made by the player. Buying the WOOD SPEAR not only changes the hands
      of the player and equips the SPEAR by default, it also unlocks SPEAR STRIKE that can be used in battle. This attack is similar to SUPER PUNCH, but instead, it does variable damage instead
      of a fixed amount.
    </p>

    <h2>Buying Items</h2>

    <img src="../images/helpTwo.png" class="rough">
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="../images/helpThree.png" class="rough">

    <p>
      Image A: This is the screen that you are greeted with when you click the SHOP button from the Hideout. This screen brings up the Shop Keeper. In the top right, there is a button that
      will allow you to return to the hideout once you have purchased an item or items. The button at the bottom labelled BUY brings up the menu where you can buy items to
      enhance your attacks and restore your HP. However, these items cost gold! So, make sure that you don't die in battle or in the mines!
      <br>
      <br>
      Image B: This is the menu where the player can purchase items depending on the gold that they have in their wallet. The WOOD SPEAR increases the attack damage
      by unlocking a new move called SPEAR STRIKE. The POTION items can be bought individually for 10 gold a piece or in bulk for 20% off. These items allow the player
      to increase their HP by 20 when in dire need during battle.
    </p>

    <h2>Packing Your Bags</h2>

    <img src="../images/helpSeven.png" class="rough">

    <p>
			This is where you can see your stats and overall progression in the game. On the left side of the BAG, you'll see your items. For example, if you've bought any potions,
			a potion image will appear in the items menu along with a label that shows the amount of potions you have. Using the text box on the right,
			you can type in a name you wish to be identified as in the game, and then press SUBMIT for your name to be saved. Below the portrait of the player are the player's
			statistics. For example, the amount of damage your attack does (ATK), your defence (DEF), your health (HP), and your speed (SPD). You can also see your XP (short for Experience Points),
			which identifies the amount of points you need to get from defeating enemies in order to level up. This will allow you to increase your previously mentioned player statistics. In the bottom
			right, you can see the amount of gold you have, in case you forgot and need to plan out if you're going to the shop or not.
    </p>

    <h2>Digging For Gold</h2>

    <img src="../images/helpEight.png" class="rough">

    <p>
      This is the area that many players will overlook. However, these mines are filled with extra goodies for those who pay attention. Filled with moving platforms,
      obstacles and parkour, the MINES will surely be a challenge for all players. Control your character using the A, D, S and SPACE keys on your keyboard and run, slide and jump
      away to get that gold coin! Who knows, maybe this will help you with getting that WOODEN SPEAR that you want so bad! BUT, THERE IS A CATCH!!! If you die in the MINES section
      by falling into the gaps between the platforms, you will lose ALL of your progress and must restart the game FROM THE BEGINNING! Safe travels into the mines of Bellowville, O Player!
    </p>

		<h2>General Tips to Play Our Game</h2>

		<p>
			Tip #1: All buttons on any screen in the game must be accessed through clicking them with your cursor.
			<br>
      <br>
			Tip #2: You can use a potion to heal health and attack an enemy during the same turn, so don't worry about choosing one over the other.
			<br>
      <br>
			Tip #3: If you name yourself using the BAG, don't worry about capitalizing any words, as that will be done for you (e.g. entering, "the king of cool" will output your name as, "The King Of Cool").
			<br>
      <br>
			Tip #4: You can ledge grab in the MINES. In simpler terms, if you are close to jumping on a platform but end up falling, as long as you keep moving in the direction towards the platform that is closest to you, you will be able to perform a small movement boost and successfully travel to the top of the desired platform.
			<br>
      <br>
			Tip #5: If you want to buy potions at the shop, you can get a deal and buy 5 of them for the price of 4!
			<br>
      <br>
			Tip #6: If your speed is higher than the enemy's, you will attack first!
