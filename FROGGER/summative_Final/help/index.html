			This is the Help Page for our game, Frogger: New Horizons! If you play our game, you will be greeted with a menu screen. To get passed this menu screen, you must <strong> press enter </strong>. After the menu screen, you will be loaded into the first level of our game, the forest level. From this point on if you die or get the fly, your next level will be randomly generated and chosen out of 3 levels. The levels are as follows, a forest level, a desert level, and an ice level. To move through these levels and capture the fly objective, you must use the <strong>>up, left, right, and down arrows </strong> to control the frog. For every fly you get, the counter in the top left of the different levels' screens will go up. However, each time you die the counter will restart. So the goal for this game, is to get as many flies as you can without dying! Unfortunately for the frog, there are many ways to die. If you die, you will be treated to a game over screen. If you want to play again after dying, you can <strong>press enter</strong> whilst being on the game over screen. You can die if you get hit by a car, train, snowball, snowmobile, or fall into the water. To avoid falling into the water, you must jump on the logs. As your playing, you may sometimes find a boot with wings, that acts as a powerup! This powerup will give the frog extra speed, so you can get to the fly easier, and faster! Knowing all of this information should be enough to help you collect lots of flies! Also, if you want to pause the game, you can <strong>press P </strong> at anytime. You can also unpause by <strong>pressing the ESC Key and the P key at the same time</strong>, however, it will bring you back to the start of the level. So good luck, and enjoy playing Frogger: New Horizons!
