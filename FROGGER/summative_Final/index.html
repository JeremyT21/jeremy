			Frogger: New Horizons
			<br>
			<br>

			 Project Description:
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 This game is a classic revamp of the childhood favourite, Frogger. Using Phaser, we have meticulously crafted a new Frogger experience, called Frogger: New Horizons! You once again play as Frogger, who is hungry and needs a snack. To cure Frogger's hunger, you must cross the road and eat the Fly! Each road Frogger must cross is filled with dangerous obstacles, so be careful! If Frogger gets hit even once, it's lights out. Don't worry though, because sometimes there will be power-ups that help Frogger gain new abilities while he's on the hunt for flies. With all that said, we hope you enjoy Frogger: New Horizons!
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 Resources We Will Need:
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 The certain sprites we need are as follows, a birds-eye view of a frog, a road tileset, a grass tileset, a train sprite, a car sprite, a truck sprite, a fly sprite, a button sprite, and a star sprite. The certain sounds we need are as follows, a frog hop, a victory sound (that plays when you get a fly), ambient frog noises, a car sound, a train sound,  a fly sound, a hit sound, game music, and a button being pressed sound. The index.html files we need are as follows, a file for code, rough sketches, help on how to play the game, a file to play the game. We also need a styles.css file to style our webpages. We also need a code.js file, to write the code for the game using Phaser. We also need a web server to run the game on. The screens our game will have our has follows, a menu screen to play the game, a game over screen if Frogger gets hit by an obstacle, and a level screen that loads the randomized level which the player must navigate through to get the fly.
