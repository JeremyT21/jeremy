		<h2>Explaining the Mockup Screenshots</h2>
		<p>
			The first mockup screenshot, is what the player will first see when they play our game. Its purpose is to greet the player, and give the player a sense of what they're about to play. The second mockup screenshot is what our game's gameplay will look like. It shows the objective the player must reach, the player's score in the top right, what the player controls, and obstacles that the player will face. It is also important to know that some elements of our game will be randomly generated (e.g. where the car spawns, where the train spawns, etc.). The last mockup screenshot is what the player will see when they touch an obstacle (e.g. frog or train). It will act as a game over screen, so the player will no longer be able to continue playing after they die.
